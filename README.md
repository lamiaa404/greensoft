university project for a website that collects energy data from a certain number of pcs located in the buildings of the university from a MQTT broker and saves it in the database and then statistics (max, mean, idle) are calculated and presented as graphs and bar plot for the user. Live energy data is fetched from the backend and presented in frontend as a graph showing timeline and live/historical energy data of the pc.
Currently running on the university server only.
